                                                   The accuracy at this point is very good .\\n25                                                                                                                                              While the 255W routing seems generally accurate and logical, on my first use I discovered that it does have some errors in its internal map .\\n26

wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .\\n27

from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n29

level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32

         I was blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

                                                     The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

the Navigon .\\n40                                                                                                                          After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41
